# personality-aura-quiz


I want to create a personality quiz that will assign the person who takes the quiz one of four auras at the end of the quiz based on the way they respond to each of the ten questions that I want generated. The questions should be around personality and taste preferences, so favorite music genre, favorite genre movie, interior design, vibes, their preferred weekend, whether they prefer being with a lot of people or a few people, introvert, extrovert. The way they respond to those questions should dictate, they should hold weight and correlate to each of the four auras, so we want to assign point values to each and ensure that they accurately correlate with the auras assigned at the end of the quiz. As for the design of the quiz, it should be minimal, white, simple text, modern, minimal.
